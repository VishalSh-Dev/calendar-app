### Step 1: Clone the Repository

### Step 2: Backend Setup  

1. Navigate to the backend directory:  

```bash
cd backend  
```  

2. Install backend dependencies:  

```bash
npm install  
```  

3. Configure the database:  
   - Ensure MongoDB is running locally or via Atlas.  
   - The application will automatically create necessary collections on first run.  

4. Start the backend server:  

```bash
npm run server  
```

### Step 3: Frontend Setup  

1. Open a new terminal window and navigate to the root directory of the project.  

2. Move to the frontend directory:  

```bash
cd frontend  
```  

3. Install frontend dependencies:  

```bash
npm install  
```  

4. Create a `.env.local` file in the `frontend` directory and add the following:  

```bash
VITE_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000  
```  

5. Start the frontend development server:  

```bash
npm run dev  
```

### Step 4: Access the Application  

1. Open your browser.  
2. Navigate to the URL displayed in the terminal (e.g., http://localhost:5173).  
3. The Communication Tracker application should now be running.

### Troubleshooting  

- **CORS Issues**: Ensure the backend is configured to allow requests from the frontend's URL.  
- **Database Connection Issues**: Confirm that MongoDB is running and verify the connection string in the backend `.env` file.  
- **Missing Dependencies**: If you encounter errors, run `npm install` in both `frontend` and `backend` directories.
